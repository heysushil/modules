Save full date on db table and get it as you want

Like you save date on table by
$date = date("Y-m-d l H:i:s");

It saves in table like this 2019/4/14 01:25:00

So you want date time day seperatly on table
If you take data on foreach 

<?php foreach($booking as $val){ $date = date_create($val->bookingDate);?>

<td><?php echo date_format($date,"Y/m/d") ;?></td>
<td><?php echo date_format($date,"l") ;?></td>
<td><?php echo date_format($date,"h:i A") ;?></td>
